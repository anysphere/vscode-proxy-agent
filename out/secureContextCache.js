// Cache of SecureContexts built by the patched createSecureContext for a given trust set.
// OpenSSL 3's provider-based decoder makes parsing a CA set expensive, and that cost is otherwise
// paid on every TLS connection because a fresh context is built each time. Reusing one context per
// distinct trust set is the mitigation OpenSSL itself recommends ("load once, use multiple times",
// https://github.com/openssl/openssl/discussions/22900).
//
// The trust set is whichever of the caller `ca` and the injected additional-CA array are present —
// both are stable references in practice: `ca` is proxy-agent's `systemCA` carried by a cached
// undici Agent, and the additional-CA array comes from getOrLoadAdditionalCertificates, which caches
// and reuses it. The context is keyed on those two references, then on a signature of the few other
// context-affecting options the cache is willing to key on. Anything else (per-identity key material,
// a string `ca` that can't be referenced, crl/dhparam/...) disqualifies caching, so those callers get
// a fresh context exactly as before. The WeakMaps let contexts for a dropped array be collected.
//
// Cached contexts are shared across connections and must never be mutated after they have been stored.
